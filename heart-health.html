    <h1>The Heart: A Vital Organ of Life</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>The human heart is one of the most vital organs in the body, responsible for pumping blood and supplying oxygen and nutrients to various parts of the body. It functions as the central component of the circulatory system, ensuring that blood circulates efficiently to sustain life. Understanding the heart's structure, functions, and ways to maintain its health is crucial for overall well-being.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card section">
      <h2>Structure of the Heart</h2>
      <p>The heart is a muscular organ located slightly to the left of the center of the chest. It is about the size of a clenched fist and consists of four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle. The right side of the heart pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs for oxygenation, while the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.</p>
      <p>The heart also contains four main valves—the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves—which ensure that blood flows in the correct direction and prevent backflow. These valves open and close with each heartbeat, maintaining an efficient circulatory process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card section">
      <h2>Function of the Heart</h2>
      <p>The primary function of the heart is to circulate blood throughout the body. This process involves two major circuits:</p>
      <h3>Pulmonary Circulation</h3>
      <p>Blood travels from the right side of the heart to the lungs, where it receives oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood then returns to the left side of the heart.</p>
      <h3>Systemic Circulation</h3>
      <p>The left side of the heart pumps oxygen-rich blood to the entire body. After delivering oxygen and nutrients, the blood returns to the right side of the heart to repeat the cycle.</p>
      <p>The heart beats approximately 100,000 times per day, pumping nearly 2,000 gallons of blood. This continuous process is essential for delivering nutrients, removing waste products, and maintaining stable body functions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card section">
      <h2>Common Heart Conditions</h2>
      <p>Several conditions can affect the heart's health, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):</strong> Caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries due to plaque buildup.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart Attack:</strong> Occurs when a blockage prevents blood flow to the heart muscle.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart Failure:</strong> A condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrhythmia:</strong> An irregular heartbeat that can cause palpitations or dizziness.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):</strong> Excessive pressure on the artery walls that can lead to heart disease.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card section">
      <h2>Maintaining a Healthy Heart</h2>
      <p>Keeping the heart healthy requires lifestyle choices that support cardiovascular function. Here are some essential tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eat a Balanced Diet:</strong> Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting saturated fats, sodium, and processed sugars.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Smoking and Excessive Alcohol:</strong> These habits can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Blood Pressure and Cholesterol:</strong> Regular check-ups can help detect heart problems early.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Enough Sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours per night.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card section">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The heart plays a crucial role in sustaining life by ensuring the continuous circulation of blood. Understanding its functions and taking proactive steps to maintain its health can prevent cardiovascular diseases and enhance overall well-being. By adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle, individuals can reduce their risk of heart-related complications and lead a longer, healthier life.</p>
